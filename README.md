# UiPath RPA Project - Automated Invoice Processing

**Author:** Rayen Mabrouki  
**Tools:** UiPath Studio, Excel, PDF Reader  
**Workflows:** Sequence, Flowchart, State Machine

## 🧠 Overview
This project automates the process of reading supplier invoices in PDF format, extracting key data (Invoice No, Date, Amount), validating the information, and saving it to an Excel file.  
It is implemented in three UiPath workflow styles to illustrate different automation architectures.

## ⚙️ Project Components
- **Sequence Workflow:** Simple linear process for PDF reading and data extraction.  
- **Flowchart Workflow:** Conditional routing for validation and decision logic.  
- **State Machine Workflow:** Robust control flow with error handling and state transitions.  

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `/UiPath_Project`: Contains all `.xaml` workflows.  
- `/Documentation`: Business Case, PDD, and SDD.  
- `/Samples`: Sample invoices and output Excel.  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `Main.xaml` in UiPath Studio.  
2. Update file paths (input PDFs, output Excel).  
3. Run the process.  
4. Check results in the `output` folder.
